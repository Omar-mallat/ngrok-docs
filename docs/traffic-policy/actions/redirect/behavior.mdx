## Behavior

If the specified `from` regular expression matches the request URL, the URL will 
be modified according to the `to` field. If no `from` field is specified, the 
entire URL will be treated as a match.

When a match is found and the request URL is modified by the `to` field, the 
action will return a temporary `302` redirect by default, unless specified 
otherwise through the `status_code` field.

If the request URL is not changed, the action will take no further action.

### String interpolation

You can access Traffic Policy variables and embed CEL expressions in this
actions configuration values using string interpolation templates in the form of 
`${expression}`. Refer to [the examples](#examples) below for demonstrations.

**Note:** All string interpolation will occur **before** regular expressions
are evaluated.

For a complete list of variables and how to write expressions, see 
[Expressions](/http/traffic-policy/expressions/variables/) and 
[Variables](/http/traffic-policy/expressions/) documentation.
