## Behavior

This action replaces all matches of the`from` regular expression in the request 
URL with the`to` replacement value.

### Matching

Matching is done against the full URL, including the scheme, userinfo, host, and 
port, not just the path.

To match requests that start with `/products` you must use 
[String Interpolation](#string-interpolation) and write 
`^${req.url.authority}/products` or use an expression like 
`req.url.path.startsWith('/products')` in the policy rule `expressions` field.

### String interpolation

You can access Traffic Policy variables and embed CEL expressions in this
actions configuration values using string interpolation templates in the form of 
`${expression}`. Refer to [the examples](#examples) below for demonstrations.

**Note:** All string interpolation will occur **before** regular expressions
are evaluated.

For a complete list of variables and how to write expressions, see 
[Expressions](/http/traffic-policy/expressions/variables/) and 
[Variables](/http/traffic-policy/expressions/) documentation.
